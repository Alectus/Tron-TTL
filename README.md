# Tron-TTL
22-02-2021
Trying to make a replica of the gigatron in simulide. The numbers refer to the numbers of the schematics in the manual. For example: schematic 4-8 is page 51 in the manual where Id: 4/8 is pictured.

The Rom is uploaded with the program ROMv1.rom. It can be found here : https://github.com/kervinck/gigatron-rom

'Tron 10 completed' is my final result and it doesn't do much, it runs 3 clock cycles and starts over again. However, the simulation drawing is as close as I could get it to the original and is double checked for mistakes. Feel free to take it from here and do some programming or experimenting to improve it.
